# DnD_Calculator

A simple website for calculating the likelihood of loaded DnD dice.

## Usage

Users simply upload a spread sheet (example provided) with the number of sides their dice has and the number of times each side has come up out of their test roles. Ideally, the user should role their die at least 10-30 times per side of the die (i.e. 200-600 for a D20) to obtain accurate results. 

The site will then compute a Chi Square value and inform the user if the value indicates the dice are loaded or not. 

A live version can be found here:

As of 2025, Heroku's pricing has made it unsustainable to continue hosting there. Currently, I am looking for new hosting options. 

## Support

Contacting me is the best way to obtain support. 

## Raodmap

Once the site is live, the project will have no further steps planned. That said, I am always open to further imporvements should the need arise.
